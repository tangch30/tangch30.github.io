## About Me

Hello there, my name is Cheng Tang. This is my career website. Until early 2021, I was an applied scientist at AWS AI Labs, shortly working on its machine learning platform Sagemaker [Object2Vec](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introduction-to-amazon-sagemaker-object2vec/) and then moved to a Large-Language-Model based search service [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2018 from The George Washington University, working with Professor [Claire Monteleoni](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/claire-monteleoni/). During my PhD years, I mostly worked on advancing the theoretical understanding of a popular clustering heuristic, k-means method and its stochastic-gradient based variants. 

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in machine learning, with a heavier emphasis on the theoretical understanding of deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Currently, I'm interested in learning more about topics such as NTK (and the related NNGP), LLM for scientific discovery, and the learning-theoretic aspects of modern ML. Please shoot me an email at ``tangch30@outlook.com'', if you are interested in research collaboration or just a casual discussion.
